            <p>The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 
                1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, 
                and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the 
                text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web; 
                on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on for the authoritative history of lorem ipsum.</p>
